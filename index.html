      <p>
        I was born and raised in Brazil and carry my culture with pride. From food to music to the language I love—it all shapes who I am today.
        I enjoy early morning workouts, quiet moments, and cooking delicious Brazilian meals. I believe in consistency, kindness, and staying grounded in faith.

        Music is part of my everyday life, and there's one song from Brazil that always lifts my spirit and reminds me of home.
